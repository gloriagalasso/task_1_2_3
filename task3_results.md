# Task 3 — Semantic Context Comparison: Patents vs. Scientific Papers

## Quantitative Similarity Measure

Cosine similarity was computed between the patent-context embedding and the paper-context embedding for each focal term. Scores range from -1 to 1, where 1 means identical context and 0 means unrelated.

| Statistic | Value |
|---|---|
| Mean | 0.352 |
| Median | 0.357 |
| Std Dev | 0.152 |
| Min | -0.008 |
| Max | 0.843 |

The distribution is approximately bell-shaped and centred around 0.35, indicating moderate but not high semantic alignment between patent and paper usage on average. The std of 0.15 shows meaningful variation across focal terms.

## Examples Illustrating Similarities and Differences

### High Similarity — Focal Terms Used in Similar Contexts

| Focal Term | Patent ID | Similarity | Patent Context (sample) | Paper Context (sample) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `asbestos-related` | 8168398 | 0.843 | mesothelioma, presence, method, human, assaying | mesothelioma, cancer, disease, presence, asbestos |
| `asbestos` | 8168398 | 0.820 | mesothelioma, presence, method, human, assaying | mesothelioma, cancer, enzyme-linked, presence |
| `presence` | 8168398 | 0.801 | mesothelioma, assaying, concluded, increased | mesothelioma, cancer, disease, asbestos, normal |
| `cocaine` | 8084204 | 0.792 | pocket, insoluble, release, indicator, method | pocket, insoluble, binding, ligand, selective |
| `risk` | 8168398 | 0.784 | mesothelioma, presence, method, human, increased | mesothelioma, cancer, chemoprevention, decline |

**Interpretation:** These focal terms belong to narrow, domain-specific topics (e.g. asbestos-related disease diagnosis). Patents and papers share a tight vocabulary, leading to high contextual alignment.

### Low Similarity — Focal Terms Used in Different Contexts

| Focal Term | Patent ID | Similarity | Patent Context (sample) | Paper Context (sample) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `first` | 7838242 | -0.008 | bacteria, listeria, delivery, method, release | insulin, hypoglycemia, pump, long-term, risk |
| `second` | 7838242 | -0.006 | bacteria, listeria, delivery, method, release | insulin, hypoglycemia, pump, long-term, risk |
| `group` | 7790843 | 0.010 | amino acid, sequence, 1-220, 221-454, seq | brain, cortex, morphometric, cerebral, region |
| `group` | 7754703 | 0.024 | hydroxyl, aryl, carbon, fluorine, chemical | insulin, immunosuppression, release, potent |
| `less` | 8052734 | 0.032 | width, hinge, expandable, sectional, mm | brachytherapy, stenting, intimal, clinical |

**Interpretation:** Generic terms like `group`, `first`, `second`, and `less` carry very different meanings depending on context. When the patent and its cited paper belong to different sub-fields, even shared terms reflect divergent usage.
