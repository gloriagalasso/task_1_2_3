## Distribution Plot

![Histogram of Focal Terms per Patent](../visualizations/histogram_focal_terms.png)

The histogram shows the number of focal terms per patent. The red dashed line marks the **mean (7.82)** and the orange dashed line marks the **median (6.00)**. The gap between mean and median confirms the distribution is **right-skewed**; a few patents with many focal terms pull the mean upward.

## Brief Descriptive Interpretation

The 101 patents share on average **7.8 focal terms** with their cited scientific papers, totalling **790 unique (patent_id, focal_term) pairs**. The distribution is right-skewed: most patents have few focal terms, while a small number have many.

**Examples:**

| Patent ID | Focal Terms (n) | Focal Terms |
|---|---|---|
| 7749408 | 1 (min) | *"room"* |
| 7884261 | 6 (median) | *"increase", "plant", "promoter", "rice", "transgenic", "yield"* |
| 8280136 | 30 (max) | *"cardiac", "heart", "dyssynchrony", "myocardial", "device", "model", ...* |
